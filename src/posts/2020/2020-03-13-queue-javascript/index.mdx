## [#](#what) What's a Queue?

In computer science, a **queue** is a data structure, and one of the [abstract data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type). Specifically, it's a type of [collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collection_(abstract_data_type)) (meaning a list of items, similar to an array). What makes a queue distinct is that it's constrained by specific rules governing how items can be added and removed, much like a stack. *(If you're not sure what a stack is, check out my previous post, [How (and Why) To Implement a Stack in JavaScript](/2020/2020-03-11-stack-javascript/).)*

While a stack enforces a Last In, First Out (LIFO) order, where items can only be added to or removed from a *single end* of the stack, a queue enforces a **First In, First Out (FIFO)** order, where items can only be inserted into one end of the queue (the **tail**) and only removed from the *other* end of the queue (the **head**).

<br/>

Inserting an item into a queue is called an **enqueue** operation, and removing an item is called a **dequeue** operation.

## [#](#why) Why Might We Want to Use a Queue?

[As we learned](/2020/2020-03-11-stack-javascript/), a stack doesn't provide much of a performance benefit over a native JavaScript array, because the `Array.prototype.push()` and `Array.prototype.pop()` methods have been optimized to provide a stack-like [nearly-**O(1)** efficiency](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/697918/what-does-o1-access-time-mean). This means that no matter how large the array is, push and pop operations should take around the same amount of time.

On the other hand, `Array.prototype.shift()` and `Array.prototype.unshift()` are closer to **O(n)** efficient, meaning the greater the length of the array is, the longer they will take:

<br/>

![Two charts showing push performance barely changing over time and unshift performance increasing exponentially over time](https://i.imgur.com/EK5UNBD.png)
*The performance of `.push()` doesn't change much as the array grows, but `.unshift()` gets substantially slower. [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44031591/performance-of-array-push-vs-array-unshift)*

<br/>

This is because every single item in the array must have its index incremented. With a new `array[0]`, the item previously at `array[0]` becomes `array[1]`, the item at `array[1]` becomes `array[2]`, etc. *(Technically, [this isn't strictly speaking true in JavaScript due to some clever optimizations](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44031591/performance-of-array-push-vs-array-unshift), but it's how it works conceptually)*.

A queue provides an intriguing alternative: by limiting ourselves to a First In, First Out method of interacting with a list, we can reduce that **O(n)** to an **O(1)** efficiency.

<a name='how'></a>

## [#](#how) How to Implement a Basic Queue

Conceptually, a stack allowed us to keep its add/remove operations efficient by keeping track of the index of the item at one end of the list. So with a queue, since we're interacting with *both* ends of the list, we'll need to keep track of *both* ends' indices:

```js
function Queue () {
  let data = {};
  let headIndex = 0;
  let tailIndex = 0;
}
```

### Implementing `.enqueue()`

```js
function Queue () {
  let data = {};
  let headIndex = 0;
  let tailIndex = 0;

  this.enqueue = function () {
    data[tailIndex];
    tailIndex++;
  }
}
```

### Implementing `.dequeue()`

```js
function Queue () {
  let data = {};
  let head = 0;
  let tail = 0;

  this.enqueue = function () {
    data[tail];
    tail++;
  }

  this.dequeue = function () {
    let item = data[head];
    delete data[head];
    head++;
    return item;
  }
}
```

## [#](#performance) Head to Head Performance Battle: Queue vs. Array

This is it. The big show. The match you've been waiting for. The Battle of the Lists. 

In one corner: the native JavaScript array. One list to rule them all, a Swiss army knife of methods -- but is it just too big and slow to compete against a lean young upstart? 

And in the other corner: the challenger, a basic queue we wrote in only 17 lines of code! Is is it too small to go toe-to-toe with the defending champ? We're about to find out.

**The below code block is live-rendering React** (scroll to below the code block to see our test component -- it's the white rectangle stuck to the bottom of the code block).

In the code below, we will:
- Declare our Queue function
- Set up a `testList` function that will enqueueing onto, and then dequeueing from, a given list a certain number of times, using `performance.now()`
- Build a small React component that allows us to input the number of times to enqueue/dequeue, allows us to click to start tests using both a native JavaScript array and our `Queue` function, and then displays the time in milliseconds to enqueue/dequeue the given number of items -- along with which list was faster.

```jsx react-live
function Queue () {
  let data = {};
  let head = 0;
  let tail = 0;

  this.enqueue = function () {
    data[tail];
    tail++;
  }

  this.dequeue = function () {
    let item = data[head];
    delete data[head];
    head++;
    return item;
  }
}

function testList (count, enqueueFn, dequeueFn) {
  let startTime = performance.now();
  for (var i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    enqueueFn();
  }
  for (var i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    dequeueFn();
  }
  let endTime = performance.now();
  return endTime - startTime;
}

const TestArea = props => {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(500);
  const [resultQueue, setResultQueue] = React.useState(0);
  const [resultArray, setResultArray] = React.useState(0);

  const runTest = () => {
    let queue = new Queue();
    let array = [];

    let nextResultQueue = testList(
      count,
      () => { queue.enqueue(1); },
      () => { queue.dequeue(); }
    );

    let nextResultArray = testList(
      count,
      () => { array.unshift(1); },
      () => { array.pop(); }
    );

    setResultQueue(nextResultQueue);
    setResultArray(nextResultArray);
  };

  return (
    <div style={{ padding: `0 20px 40px` }}>
      <h2 style={{ color: 'steelblue' }}>Performance Battle</h2>

      <div>
        Number of enqueues / dequeues: 
        <input 
          type='text' 
          value={count} 
          onChange={e => setCount(e.target.value)} 
        />
      </div>
      {count > 99999 && <div style={{ color: 'red' }}>
        Warning! This many enqueues / dequeues may slow or crash your browser!
      </div>}
      <button onClick={runTest}>Run test</button>
      
      <br/><br/>

      <div>
        Queue: {resultQueue}
      </div>
      <div>
        Array: {resultArray}
      </div>
    
    </div>
  );
};

render(<TestArea/>);
```

Try running the test with 5000 enqueues/dequeues and with 50000 enqueues/dequeues, and see what happens.

Did you try it?

Neat, huh?

Even increasing the number by *orders of maginitude* barely budges the time it takes for the queue operations to finish, while the array operations start neck-and-neck with the queue at a low number, but quickly start to balloon as it gets larger.

Can you believe it? We beat native JavaScript arrays at their own game. 

It's official: Queues are FIFO World Champs.
