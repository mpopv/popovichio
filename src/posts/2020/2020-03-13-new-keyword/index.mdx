## What the `new` keyword does

1. Create a new plain object

2. Calls the function referenced with `new` as the constructor function for the new object, and bind's the constructor's `this` to the new object.

3. The new object becomes the returned result of the expression--_unless_ the constructor function returns its own object, in which case _that_ object is returned.

Compare:

```js
function Car(make) {
  this.make = make;
}

let car = new Car('Honda'); // { make: 'Honda' }
console.log(car.make); // 'Honda'
```

```js
function Car(make, model) {
  this.make = make;
  return { model };
}

let car = new Car('Honda', 'Civic'); // { model: 'Civic' }
console.log(car.make); // 'undefined
```

In the second case, returning an object from the constructor function returns _that_ object from the `new` expression rather than the new object we've created and bound the constructor's `this` to. So, properties set on the constructor's `this` are _not_ available in the result of the `new` expression.

## Classes and `new`

In JavaScript, classes are essentially syntactic sugar for functions. So while a class declaration will look different from a constructor function, under the hood they are being called the same way.
