# RAM

- RAM: "bookcase" holding individual "shelves".
- byte: a single "shelf" of RAM.
- bit: a 0/1 binary switch. a byte contains 8 bits.

# integers

- variables have a type that corresponds with a size. a single byte can only express 256 different numbers (2^8). this is an 8-bit unsigned integer. if we want more than that, we have to use a larger type of FIXED-WIDTH UNSIGNED INTEGER. for example, 32-bit integers have 2^32, or over 4 billion, possible values. 64-bit integers have 2^64, or over 10 billion billion, possible values. for these types of multi-byte values, the memory address in RAM points to a set of bytes representing the value.

# arrays

- so let's say we have an array of integers with fixed width, meaning they all take up the same number of bits, no matter how big the values are. if all values are the same number of bits, it's easy to determine the index of the memory address holding a value at some array index. (4th item times each item is 8 bytes long = indices 25 through 32.)

- why does looking up an array item at an index take O(1) time? the memory controller has DIRECT ACCESS to each memory address. so it can go to the right address immediately.

# strings

- conceptually, a string is fundamentally an array of characters.
- how to store string characters in memory? map them to numbers. this mapping is called a CHARACTER ENCODING. ASCII, UTF-8, etc.
- example: in ASCII, the letter `A` is mapped to the number `65`, which is `01000001` in binary.
- so, we can store strings as arrays of numbers in memory. then, we can decode them into strings, as long as we know the character encoding.

```
01001110
01001001
01000011
01000101
```

is

```
78
73
67
69
```

which is

```
N
I
C
E
```

# pointers

so what if we need an array of strings? this is effectively an array of ARRAYS of numbers. and each sub-array has a different length, so we can't use the fixed-width trick.

instead, we'll just put the array items wherever they'll fit in memory, then construct a list of _pointers_ to the indices where the items begin.

this is less efficient, because we're storing array items' values wherever, rather than in sequential fixed-width increments. but it's still O(1) efficient.

# dynamic arrays

in lower-level languages, arrays have a predetermined width declared upfront. what happens when we don't know how many items we want in an array? we give it a starting fixed width, then program it to resize itself when it runs out of space.

the array will allocate a certain amount of memory, then store the `end_index`. once it allocates the last address of that block, it will create a new, bigger array -- usually twice as big; this is called 'doubling'. then it will copy each element over and free up the old array in memory. it CAN'T simply extend the array size in memory since something else might have used up the addresses immediately after the array's addresses.

this is ALWAYS an O(n) time operation because of the need to copy all array items over. this means, for dynamic arrays, appends are usually O(1) but occasionally have an append that costs O(n). HOWEVER, each time you hit an O(n) append, it's twice as long to the next one. so, each append takes _twice as long_ as the last one, but it also takes _twice as long_ to get to. since these average out into a constant average time over the long term, the average or 'AMORTIZED' cost is O(1).

so dynamic arrays are:

- good when you don't know how much space you'll need
- bad if you know exactly how much space you'll need; you use a fixed size array instead
- bad if you are doing many appends, because append time cost is higher

# linked lists

- before, we use pointers to get around length issues with dynamic arrays. so if we took this idea to the extreme, we could encode, say, a string as a list where every character is a two-index array: the first index is the value of the character, and the second item is a pointer to the next two-index character.
- each of these is called a 'node' and this is called a 'linked list' (specifically, a singly linked list)
- first node: head. we also have to have an additional pointer keeping track of where this is, so we know where the list begins. this is needed for prepends.
- last node: tail. we want a pointer pointed to this, too. needed for appends.

so linked lists are:

- best if you want to do a lot of appends; appends are _always_ O(1), not just amortized O(1); there is no worst case where an append costs O(n).
- not great if space efficiency is most important, because they take up more space -- each node has to encode the location of the next as well as its own value.
- not great if you want to access by index or append/remove items in the middle. you need to walk the list to discover values. you can't just jump to the fifth item in the list.

# hash tables

what if we need to story by key? i.e., keep a count of each word in this novel. we need a data structure where they key is the word, and the value is the count.

- we need a HASHING FUNCTION that can convert string keys to numbers, ideally in a collision-resistant way.

- if collisions are unavoidable, we can have a pointer to a linked list if a collision occurs. that way, lookups are amortized O(1), although certain worst-case lookups -- of keys that collided -- will be O(n).
