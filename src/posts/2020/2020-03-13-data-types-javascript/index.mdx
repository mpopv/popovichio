How many data types are in JavaScript?

# Primitive data types

1. undefined `typeof instance === "undefined"`

Any variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

2. Boolean `typeof instance === "boolean"`

One of `true` or `false`.

3. Number `typeof instance === "number"`
4. BigInt `typeof instance === "bigint"`

Two ways to use numbers.

5. String `typeof instance === "string"`

6. Symbol `typeof instance === "symbol"`

# Reference types

All of these are actually different forms of `object`. All of the are passed by reference, rather than by value.

1. Function `typeof instance === "function"`

2. Object `typeof instance === "object"`

Array, Set, Map, WeakMap, WeakSet, Date, and things made with `new` operator

3. null `typeof instance === "object"`

A special type that is always the earliest ancestor in the prototype chain.

# Passed by value vs. passed by reference
